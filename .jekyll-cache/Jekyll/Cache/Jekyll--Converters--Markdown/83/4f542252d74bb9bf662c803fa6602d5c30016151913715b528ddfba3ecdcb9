<p>Ever since I got my first computer, Iâ€™ve been intrigued by how they work. I always loved discovering new tricks and learning about the inner workings of the machines. As time went on, I discovered programming and found my passion. I started out by teaching myself Batch, the Microsoft command line language. From there I experimented a lot, learning to program my calculator, and messing with basic python. Then I learned about something called Jailbreaking. From there I started messing with programming for my iPhone. I learned some basic C and Objective C. While working on personal projects, I learned more detailed python, powershell, swift, and java. I quickly became interested in computer security. I plan to study computer security in college.</p>
